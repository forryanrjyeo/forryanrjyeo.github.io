        <p> Happy 27th birthday to you, my love!</p> 
          <p> Here is your 2020 CIRCUIT BREAKER EDITION of birthday card! Hehe!
          I thought I'd do something over the internet since the initial plan was not personal delivery.. but situations change sooOoOOooo... here is your birthday card replacement anyway!!! A 'dynamic' website!! 
          At the same time, I can also learn something that is close to your heart and one that you are intensively engaged in now so that I can have more "shared" experiences 
          with you. No physical shared experiences so let the virtual shared experience take over! It was actually pretty fun and enriching! I've enjoyed giving myself a headache from time to time..
         </p>
         <p>Anyhoooo, I know I promised I won't get you anything but that is literally impossible so I did it anyway. You deserve all of these (and more actually).
             Don't worry, they are well within my budget and what's better is that some are even free!? (Like this and Switch?! Hehe!) And I also just want to spoil you so so so much...
             For now, please enjoy the small "western food" treat, and when we get to see each other again, we will go and enjoy bigger and better treats from me together!!
             You can start thinking about what you would want to have because I will definitely ask you to choose... (Also please choose something nice and no need to worry about budget- I'm a rich woman!!!)
             I would also like to bring you on a staycation, just like you brought me to, and because travelling overseas is probably hard in the immediate future. This one is also an excuse for me to go on a break okay, so you cannot reject!
             Let's spend some time with just you and me ;) and create more memories right here in Singapore. 
         </p>

         <p>I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for being so supportive and try-y during this circuit breaker period. I know that I have been videocalling you alot during this period (and I will continue to do so lol) but
             that is only because my "love language" is highly physical and hence I will need to see you ever so often!!!! Not being able to hold you or be held by you is sooo tough so please bear with me while I continue to videocall you
             to not only hear your voice, but also to see your handsome face. 
         </p>
          
         <p> It has been a wild transition from 26 to 27 years of age for you, and I want you to know that everything that you had gotten you had worked so hard for, and you deserve all the recognition that 
            you got/are getting. You are worth more than you think and not only I can see that, your friends and co-workers see that too. "Blinded by love" is no longer an excuse because your friends and co-workers are not eligible for that.
            I am so proud of you being who you are and doing what you are doing so please keep it up, I will always be here to support you and see you through it.
        </p>

          <p>I am so happy to be celebrating yet another birthday with you and cheers to celebrating all our birthdays together for the rest of our lives!</p>
           <p> Once again, happy birthday to you baby!!!!!</p>
           <p>Lots and lots of love,</p>
           <p>Miao Pei</p>
